### Problem Statement

Develop a regression model to be used by real estate agents to better understand what affects the pricing of houses. Real estate agents will provide insights for homeowners to increase house prices.

---

We have all heard the common phrase "location, location, location." Location and size of the lot seems to define how much a property costs. But what else, exactly affects real estate. As we look into the correlation and regression data, although locations do affect price, however the R2 score doesn't seem to be that high only in the 0.70s. What's surprising was the R2 score when testing features such as rooms and year built. These features show 0.83 R2 scores for both training and testing models.

### Conclusions

Recommendations:
Based on the Correlation Matrix, we can see that House Quality and Year Remodel/Build are the top 10 factors for higher sale prices. Homeowners should make some home improvements to improve sale prices.
